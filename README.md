# AI_model_from_scratch
This is a small transformer based model which is the basis for all the artifical intelligence model we are seeing these days

What is AI below is an example that will help anyone debug and play around with AI on their local system.

Essentially AI models are decoder based models. In simple words it just predicts the most favorable next word for your sentence. Think of it like your soulmate trying to finish your sentences.

Now how does this decoder models finishes your sentences it does this by cheating and by learning based on how you talk. Generally these decoder models are based on transformer based architectures.

Now what is a transformer it is essentially a cluster of neural network layers in this case a cluster of embedding layer -> multi self attention layer -> dropout layer -> dense layer -> batch normalization layer.

Just using these layers all the modern AI models learn through our sentences, but enough theory guys below is the git link to a small AI model that you can use to have fun.

Fun tip change the word world to your wife/girlfriends name and then you will have an AI model talking wonderful things about them ðŸ˜†

# To run this model you can run it in local
Install tensor flow in your machine if you are running into issues installing tensorflow on local you can try to install tensorflow on collab notebooks
